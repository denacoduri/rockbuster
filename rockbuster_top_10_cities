A SQL query to find the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries:		
		
		
QUERY:

SELECT C.city, D.country,		
       COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_count		
FROM customer A		
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id		
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id		
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID		
WHERE country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 'Japan',		
	 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation', 	
	 'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')	
GROUP BY city, country		
ORDER BY customer_count DESC, city ASC		
LIMIT 10		


OUTPUT:

*This information is not very useful. Although it gives us the top city,		
all the other cities only have 1 customer each, therefore there is no		
"Top Ten." I have listed the remaining cities after Aurora in alphabetical 		
order.
